          Web-Scraping and Data Visualization of my Fantasy-Soccer Mini-League

        <h2>Description of the Project:</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a web scraping tool for my Fantasy Soccer Mini-league,
          which is a game I have been playing with very close longtime friends
          for more than ten years. This year I decided to level up my analysis
          of the game and create this interesting web-scraping project.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are not familiar with fantasy sports, they are about selecting
          players in the game's platform. Your team performs based on the
          real-life performance of the chosen players. Sure, you can choose
          players and get lucky; nevertheless, data analysis plays a large role
          in your performance.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the past years, I haven't dedicated much time to the game.
          However, this is a great opportunity for a web-scraping project
          because data are all over the place. Scraping the data presented
          several challenges that this project tackles.
        </p>
        <h3>The Challenges:</h3>
        <br />

        <p>
          I can separate this scraping project into 3 different stages that vary
          in difficulty.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          First, I scraped the General Table of my mini-league. This part of the
          scraping process was easy and only required some data cleaning handled
          with the Pandas Library. Second, I designed a web-scraping program to
          visit each team's "history" site to grab data on how they were managed
          during the last season. Finally, I wanted information on how the teams
          chose their captains. Each team has to choose one captain each week to
          score double points that specific week. Making the right decision is
          frequently the difference between a good or a bad week.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          This third stage of the web-scraping program was the biggest challenge
          because it required the program to visit the 38 game-weeks for each of
          the 30 teams and grab the datapoint. It was a total of 1140 visits and
          data collections. Moreover, the selected captain can be a defender, a
          midfielder, a forward, or even the gaolkeeper. It means that the
          element to look for could be anywhere on the pitch, which is not ideal
          for a web-scraping project. Here is an example of how one team and the
          captain selected look for a specific game-week:
